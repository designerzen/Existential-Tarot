One day, you will die
You will question your understanding of love
In the very near future, you will go to sleep disappointed
Everything you know will one day cease to exist
One day, very soon, you will feel unloved
Hunger awaits
Tiredness will one day over take you
Soon, you will feel disappointment
You will have trouble sleeping
Secretly, you will desire another
You will be critical of yourself
Confusion will begin to feel normal
